\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Optional vector identifying datasets/cohorts per sample,
used to stratify folds jointly by event indicator and dataset.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{cv_results}: per-fold, per-alpha, per-init C-index values
(one row per random start).
\item \code{summary_fold}: mean C-index for each fold and
hyperparameter combination (including alpha), averaged across
random starts.
\item \code{summary}: fold-averaged mean C-index and its SE for every
\code{(k, lambda, nu, lambdaW, lambdaH, alpha)} tuple.
\item \code{alpha_grid}: the alpha grid explored.
\item \code{hyper_grid}: the base hyperparameter grid (without alpha).
\item \code{folds}: fold assignments used in CV.
}
}
\description{
Internal helper for cross-validation over the full grid of
\code{k, alpha, lambda, nu, lambdaW, lambdaH} combinations, fitting each
alpha separately (i.e., without warmstarts). Parallelism (if enabled) is
applied at the (hyperparameter, fold, init) job level so every random
start can be scheduled independently. Folds whose training subset contains
zero events are skipped (with a warning) and contribute \code{NA} C-indices.
