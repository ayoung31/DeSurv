\description{
Internal helper for cross-validation over a grid of hyperparameters
\code{k, alpha, lambda, nu, lambdaW, lambdaH}, using warmstarts along
\code{alpha_grid} via \code{desurv_alpha_warmstart()} for each combination
of \code{k, lambda, nu, lambdaW, lambdaH}. Parallelism (if enabled) is
applied at the (hyperparameter, fold, init) job level; within each job,
\code{desurv_alpha_warmstart} is invoked for a single initialization so
nested parallelism is still avoided. Folds whose training subset has zero
observed events are skipped (emitting a warning) and contribute
\code{NA} C-indices.
