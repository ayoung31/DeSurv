Title: Survival-Driven Nonnegative Matrix Factorization
Version: 0.0.0.9000

Description: Fit a supervised nonnegative matrix factorization that
    couples latent factors learned from high-dimensional expression data with
    a Cox proportional hazards model. The package provides utilities for
    data validation, warm-started optimisation across supervision weights,
    hyper-parameter grid search with cross-validation, prediction helpers,
    and lightweight gene filtering tailored to transcriptomic assays.
